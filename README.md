## Meaning

### Etymology

Late Middle English, borrowed from Late Latin auriculāris, from auricula (“the
external ear; the ear”) + -āris (“-ar”, adjectival suffix); equivalent to
auricle + -ar. Doublet of auricularis.

The finger is so called because it can be readily introduced into the ear passage.

### Noun

**auricular** (plural auriculars)

1. The little finger, the outermost and smallest finger of the hand.

   Synonyms: ear finger, fourth finger, little finger, mercurial finger, pinkie

2. (humorous) The ear.
3. Certainly, definitely, absolutely, not just for the AUR and arr in the word.
